            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord <hi>Major,</hi> and you worthy Citizens of this famous and Magnificent City, We are ſent hither to you from the Houſe of Commons, to make known to you the diſcovery of a great and a miſchievous Deſign, tending not only to the ruine and deſtruction of the City and of the Kingdom; but in thoſe Ruines, likewiſe to have buried Religion and Liberty, I might call it a ſtrange De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, though in theſe late times deſigns of this kinde have been very frequent, becauſe it exceeds others in divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable circumſtances of it; In the malice of the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſubtilty of contrivance, extent of miſchiefe, and neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of execution, all which aroſe from the wickedneſſe of the Authors: Two others may be added, that is, the cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the diſcovery and proofe, and the greatneſſe of the deliverance, proceeding from the great mercies of God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the opening of this deſign, take this courſe for my own memory, and yours.</p>
            <p>Obſerve firſt, what was in their ayms. Secondly, the variety of preparations. Thirdly, the degrees of proceeding. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the maturity and readineſſe for execution.</p>
            <p>The Parliament, the City, and the Army, ſeem to be the three Vitall parts of this Kingdom; wherein not only the well being, but the very life and being of it doth conſiſt; this miſchief would have ſeized upon all theſe at once.</p>
            <p>The City ſhould have bin put into ſuch a combuſtion, as to have your ſwords imbrued in one anothers bloud: The Parliament ſhould have been corrupted, and betrayed by their own Members: The Army deſtroyed, if not by force, yet for want of ſupply and maintenance, that ſo they might have had an open and a cleerer way to the reſt, which they
<pb facs="tcp:155966:3"/>had in propoſition, eſpecially to that main and ſupreame end, the extirpation of Religion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall tell you firſt, out of what principles this did riſe, it was from the aſhes of another deſign that failed; that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous petition which was contrived in this City, the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of that petition being therein diſappointed, they fell preſently into conſultation how they might compaſſe their former end in another way, that is under pretence of ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves by force againſt the ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and under pretence of procuring peace, they would have made themſelves Maſters of the City, yea of the whole kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they would have ruin'd &amp; deſtroyed all thoſe that ſhould have interrupted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their miſchievous intentions.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtep in their preparation was, to appoint a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee that might often meet together, and conſult how they might compaſſe this wicked end.</p>
            <p>Their next was, that they might enable that Committee with intelligence both from the Armies, as well thoſe on the Kings ſide (as they call themſelves, though we bee of the Kings ſide indeed) as thoſe that are raiſed by the Parliament, eſpecially they were carefull to underſtand the proceedings of Parliament, that ſo by the advantage of this intelligence, they might the better effect that which they had in project, and find the readieſt and the neareſt ways to it.</p>
            <p>After they had thus provided for intelligence, how they might procure power and countenance to this action, by ſome appearing authority from His Majeſty; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; they projected to get a Commiſſion from the King, whereby many of themſelves, and of thoſe that were of their own conſort, ſhould be eſtabliſhed a Counſell of War in London and parts adjacent, with power to raiſe Forces, make proviſions of Ammunition, and of other kinde of Arms, and to give authority for the leading and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:155966:3"/>of thoſe Forces, and to raiſe money for the maintenance of them, and as it is expreſſ'd in the Commiſſion, for the deſtruction of the Army, under the command of
<hi>Robert</hi> E: of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> raiſed by authority from the two houſes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Having layd theſe grounds, I ſhall in the next place diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to you, thoſe that ſhould have bin Actors and Agents in this buſines, their ſeverall qualifications and relations.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort was ſome Members of the City, wherof there were divers, you ſhall hear the names out of the proof, and the next was (in their pretence, as they gave out) members of the two Houſes of Parliament, and the third ſort, was two Gentlemen, Maſter <hi>Waller,</hi> and a brother in law of his, Maſter <hi>Tomkins,</hi> that were to be Agents betwixt the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the City, as they pretended. Then a fourth ſort was thoſe that were to be Meſſengers to convey intelligence from this place to the Court at Oxford, and to other places where there ſhould be occaſion. And then the fift and laſt conſiſted but in one man, that we yet diſcover, and that was the Lord of <hi>Falkland,</hi> that kept correſpondency with them from the Court; theſe were to be the Actors in this miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous deſign.</p>
            <p>They began then to think upon ſome other courſes of very great advantage to themſelves.</p>
            <p>The firſt was of combination, how they might be more cloſely conjoyned one to another, and how they might bee more ſecure from all others that were not of the ſame party; And for this purpoſe, there was deviſ'd a Proteſtation of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, whereby as they were Chriſtians, they did bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to keep one anothers counſel, not to reveal that which they had knowledge off, which they were truſted with. And the ſecond was, a warineſſe in diſcovering the buſineſſe to any of thoſe who were to be brought into the plot, though they came in amongſt them to be of them, they would not
<pb facs="tcp:155966:4"/>truſt all of their own body, but they took this wary and ſubtile courſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no one man ſhould acquaint above two in this buſineſſe; that ſo if it came to examination, it ſhould never go father than three, by the ſame party that diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, and then thoſe two had the like power, that any one of them might diſcover it to two others, that ſo ſtill it might be conſin'd within the number of three: then there was a ſpeciall obligation (as was pretended by Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>) which he had made to thoſe that he ſaid were Members of both Houſes of Parliament, and conſenting to this Plot, but that is yet but a pretence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no names or parties are known.</p>
            <p>After they had provided thus for their combination, and for their ſecurity; then in the next place, they thought of ſome means of augmentation how they might encreaſe their numbers, and draw in others to come to be of their party; and for this they did reſolve to uſe all the Art and ſubtilty to irritate mens minds againſt the Parliament; they found out thoſe that thought themſelves moſt heavily burden'd with theſe taxes, they did cheriſh all that had any diſcontents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Aſſeſſement, adviſing them to repair to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for eaſe, which they knew would be difficult to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and that they being diſappointed would be more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and the apter to joyn with them in this Plot.</p>
            <p>From this care of augmentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they went in the next place, to find out ſome means of diſcovery, that they might know how far their party did extend, who were of their ſide, and who were againſt them, and for this purpoſe they did deviſe that there ſhould be a ſurvey of all the Wards, nay of all the Pariſhes within the City of London, the Suburbs and places adjoyning in every pariſh, to obſerve thoſe that were for them, whom they called right men, and others that were againſt them, whom they called averſe men; and then a third ſort, whom they called neutralls, and indifferent men;
<pb facs="tcp:155966:4"/>and they appointed ſeverall perſons that were truſted with this ſurvey and enquiry, to find out theſe ſeverall degrees and ſorts in every pariſh.</p>
            <p>Thus far this deſign ſeems to be but a work of the brain, to conſiſt only in invention and ſubtilty of deſign, but the other ſteps &amp; degrees which I ſhall now obſerve to you, will make it to be a work of the hand, to bring it ſomewhat neerer to execution.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtep that came into action and execution was, that they procur'd this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they had before deſign'd, and endeavour'd to obtain: Now they had obtain'd a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (as I told you before) to eſtabliſh certain men, 17 in number, their names are there expreſſ'd, you ſhall heare them read to you, they were to be a Counſell of War here within the city; theſe 17 men they had power to name others to themſelves, to the number of 21, &amp; they ſhould be enabled both to appoint, not only Colonells and Captains, and other inferiour officers of an Army, but to appoint and nominate a Generall; they had power to raiſe men, to raiſe Arms, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and to do all thoſe other things that I told you before, and to lay taxes and Impoſitions to raiſe money, and to execute Martiall-Law.</p>
            <p>When they had gone thus far, in the next place they did obtain a Warrant from the King, &amp; this was to M. <hi>Challener,</hi> that he might receive money and plate of all thoſe, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by voluntary contribution, or Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, would furniſh the King (as they call'd it) in this neceſſity of His, and therby the King was obliged to the repayment of it this was obtain'd.</p>
            <p>By this cometh in the liſt, that that was before part of the deſign, cometh now into act, the Citizens that were truſted with framing of this liſt, brought it in, except in ſome few pariſhes; under thoſe heads of diſcovery that I formerly told you of; that is, in every pariſh who were right, and who
<pb facs="tcp:155966:5"/>were indifferent, and neutrall, and who were averſe, and thoſe were brought to Mr.
<hi>Wallers</hi> Houſe, and after they had delivered that liſt, the Citizens then declared themſelves that now they had done their part, they had diſcovered to them a foundation of ſtrength, they did expect from them again a foundation of countenance and authority, that was from both Houſes of Parliament; and they did declare that they would proceed no farther, till they knew the names of thoſe Members of both Houſes that ſhould joyn with them, and ſhould undertake to countenance this buſines. M. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> made this anſwer, that he did aſſure them that they ſhould have Members of both Houſes, both Lords and Commons to joyn with them, that he himſelfe he was but their mouth, that he ſpoke not his owne words, but their words, that he was but their agent and did their worke, that they ſhould have of the ableſt, of the beſt, and of the greateſt Lords, and the greateſt number, nay, that they ſhould pick and chuſe, that they could not wiſh for a Lord, whom he doubted not, but to procure them; this was the vanity of his boaſting to them to draw them on, and to encourage them in this plot: This being done now, and propounded by the Citizens on their part, ſo Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> propounded from the Lords divers <hi>quaeries,</hi> queſtions which had beene framed (as he ſayd) by the Lords and Commons, and in their name he did preſent them, that were for the removall of difficulties, of ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions that might hinder this worke, thoſe <hi>quaeries</hi> were delivered upon Friday was 7 night to ſome of the Citizens, and upon the Saturday morning (that was Saturday was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven night) they were returned back again with anſwers.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now relate to you, both the <hi>quaeries,</hi> and the anſwers that were returned by thoſe of the City.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>quaerie</hi> was, what number of men there were Armed.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer was,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155966:5"/>That there was a third part well armed, and a third part with Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts, and another third part with what they could get, with that that came to hand.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Quaere</hi> was, In what places the Magazines were laid?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer to that was, At Alderman <hi>Fowk's</hi> houſe, at Leaden-Hall, and at Guild-Hall.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Quaere</hi> was, Where the Rendezvouz ſhould be?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer was, At all the Gates, at the places of the Magazines, in Cheapſide, in the Exchange, and at what other places the Lords ſhould think fit.</p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>Quaere</hi> was, Where the place of retreat, if there ſhould be occaſion?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer was, That they had Bamſtead Downs, they had Black-Heath in propoſition, but they did refer the concluſion of the place to the Lords.</p>
            <p>The fifth was, What Colours there ſhould be?</p>
            <p>To this it was anſwered, That at every Rendezvouz there ſhould be Colours.</p>
            <p>A ſixth conſideration was, By what marks &amp; tokens they ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from others, &amp; know their friends from their enemies?</p>
            <p>To that it was anſwered, That they ſhould have white Ribands, or white Tape.</p>
            <p>Then in the ſeventh place, it was asked, What ſtrength there was within the walls, and what ſtrength without the walls?</p>
            <p>To that it was anſwered, That within the walls, there was for one with them, three againſt them; but without the walls, for one againſt them, there was five for them.</p>
            <p>The eighth was, What was to be done with the Tower?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer was, That they could conclude nothing in that point?</p>
            <p>The ninth was, Where the chiefe Commanders dwelt?</p>
            <p>To that they made this Anſwer, That every Pariſh could tell what new Commanders and Captaines they had, and who of the <hi>Militia</hi> dwelt in it.</p>
            <p>The tenth and the laſt was What time this ſhould be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155966:6"/>To that the Anſwer was, That the time was wholly left to the Lords.</p>
            <p>After theſe <hi>Quaeres</hi> thus propounded and anſwered, Maſter <hi>Waller</hi> told them that he would acquaint the Lords with thoſe Anſwers that he had received from them to their <hi>Quaeres,</hi> and wiſhed them not to be troubled, though the Lords did not yet declare themſelves, for they could do them as good ſervice in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Being proceeded thus far, they came then to ſome propoſitions which ſhould be put in execution, and they were theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that they would take into their cuſtodie the Kings children that were here.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was, That they would lay hold of all thoſe perſons that they thought ſhould be able to ſtand in their way, or to give them any impediment, or at leaſt of ſome conſiderable number of them, it is unlike that all were named, but ſome were named; Of the Lords Houſe there was named my Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:</hi> and beſides my Lord Major, whom they took into their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as the head of the City; there was named of the Houſe of Commons, Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Hampden,</hi> Maſter
<hi>Strode,</hi> and they did me the honour and the favour to name me too.</p>
            <p>When they had taken into conſideration the ſurprizall of theſe Members of both Houſes, they did take into their further reſolution, that with my Lord Major ſhould have been ſeized all your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of <hi>Militia,</hi> they would not ſpare one of them.</p>
            <p>They intended further, That they would releaſe all Priſoners that had bin committed by the Parliament, that they would ſeize upon the Magazines, that they would make a declaration to ſatisfie the people.</p>
            <p>There are no Deſignes, be they never ſo ill, but they do put on a mask of ſome good, for betwixt that that is abſolutely and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ill, there is no congruity with the will of man, and therefore the worſt of evils are undertaken under a ſhadow and a ſhew of goodneſſe; this Declaration muſt be ſet out, to make the people beleeve that they ſtood up for <hi>The preſervation of Religion, For the preſervation of the Kings Prerogative, Of the liberties of the Subject, Of the Priviledges of Parliament;</hi> and of theſe 1000. were to be printed,
<pb facs="tcp:155966:6"/>they were to be ſet upon Poſts and Gates in the moſt conſiderable and open places: and they were to be diſperſed as much as they could thorow the City againſt the time it ſhould be put in execution: this was done upon Saturday laſt was ſeven-night in the morning.</p>
            <p>Then in the next place, they thought fit to give intelligence to the Court of what proceedings they had made here, and thereupon Maſter <hi>Hazel</hi> he was ſent to <hi>Oxford</hi> that very Saturday in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon from Maſter <hi>Wallers</hi> houſe, there were two Meſſages ſent by for this main Deſigne they would not truſt in writing, the firſt Meſſage was from Maſter <hi>Waller,</hi> it was that he ſhould tell my Lord of <hi>Falkland</hi> that he would give him a more full notice of the great buſineſſe very ſpeedily; the other Meſſage was from Maſter <hi>Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> and that was, That the Deſigne was now come to good maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; That they had ſo ſtrong a party in the City, that though it were diſcovered, yet they would be able to put it in execution: They promiſed to give notice to the King of the very day, and if it were poſſible, of the very hour wherein this ſhould be put in execution; and then they did deſire, That when they had ſeized upon the Out works, that there might ſome party of the Kings Army come up within fifteen miles of the City, who upon knowledge of their proceedings muſt be admitted into the City. Theſe were the foure points upon which the Meſſage did conſiſt, which was ſent from Maſter <hi>Tourkins</hi> to my Lord of
<hi>Felkland,</hi> by Maſter <hi>Hazel.</hi> To both theſe Meſſages my Lord of
<hi>Falkland</hi> returned an Anſwer by word of mouth, they kept themſelves ſo cloſely that they durſt not venture to write, but he bid the Meſſenger to tell Maſter <hi>Waller,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Tomkins,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hambden</hi> (a Gentleman, that was ſent up with a Meſſage from the King, and remained here in Town to agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this buſineſſe) made that uſe of his being here in Town, that he ſhould tell them, That hee could not well write, but did excuſe himſelfe, but pray'd them that they would uſe all poſſible haſte in the main buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Waller</hi> having plotted it, and brought it on thus far, now he began to thinke of putting it further, and the Tueſday following this Saturday, which was Tueſday was ſe'night in the evening, after
<pb facs="tcp:155966:7"/>he came home to his lodging; Maſter <hi>Tomkins</hi> and he being toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he told Maſter <hi>Tomkins,</hi> That the very next morning, that was Wedneſday, the Faſt day, he ſhould goe to my Lord of <hi>Holland,</hi> and acquaint him with this plot, diſcover ſo much to him as he thought fit, that he himſelfe would goe to ſome other Lords, and doe the like: this was the Tueſday night, in which conference they had put on that confidence in expectation of ſucceſſe in this plot, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Waller</hi> broke out with a great Oath, to affirm, That if they did carry this throughout, then we will have any thing. This he ſpake to Maſter
<hi>Tomkins</hi> with a very great deal of earneſtneſſe and aſſurance: So far they went on in hope and expectation, but here they were cut ſhort: That very night there were Warrants iſſued (upon ſome diſcoveries that were made of this Plot) to the Lord Major, to the Sheriffs here, which they did execute with ſo much diligence and care of the good of the City, that the next morning when Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Tomkins</hi> and Maſter <hi>Waller</hi> ſhould have gone about their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they were apprehended, and the reſt of the Citizens, divers of them, ſome eſcaped.</p>
            <p>Thus farre I have diſcovered to you the materials and the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this miſcievous deſigne; you ſhall now be pleaſed to hear the Proofs and the Confeſſions out of which this narration doth ariſe, and that will make all this good to you that I have ſaid; and after thoſe are read, I ſhall then tell you what hath been done ſince in the Houſe of Commons, ſomewhat in the Houſe of Lords, and what elſe is in propoſition to be offered to you from the Houſe of Commons; but I ſhall deſire you firſt that you may bee fully convinced of the great goodneſſe of God in diſcovery of this Plot, and the truth of theſe things that I have ſpoken to you, that you will hear the evidence of the proofs, and then we ſhall go on to thoſe other things which we have in charge.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>John Pym</hi> Eſquire his Speech.</head>
            <p>GEntlemen, we have held you long, you are now almoſt come to the end of your trouble; I am to deliver to you ſome ſhort obſervations upon the whole matter, and then to acquaint you with the reſolutions thereupon, taken in the Houſe of Commons; and to conclude with a few deſires from them to you:</p>
            <p>The obſervations are theſe: Firſt, I am to obſerve to you, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety betwixt the pretences with which this deſigne hath beene mark'd, and the truth: One of the pretences was peace, the truth was blood and violence; Another of the pretences was, the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of propriety, the truth was, the introducing of tyranny and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which leaves no man maſter of any thing he hath.</p>
            <p>A ſecond obſervation is this: The unnaturall way by which they meant to compaſſe this wicked deſigne, that was to deſtroy the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by the members of Parliament; and then by the carcaſſe and ſhadow of a Parliament to deſtroy the kingdome; what is a Parliament but a carkaſſe when the freedome of it is ſuppreſſed? when thoſe ſhall be taken away by violence, that can or will oppoſe and ſtand in the way of their intentions: The high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the moſt certaine and conſtant Guardian of Liberty; but if it be deprived of its owne Liberty, it is left without life or power to keep the Liberty of others; If they ſhould bring a Parliament to be ſubject to the Kings pleaſure, to be correſpondent (as they call it) to his will, in the middeſt of ſuch evill counſels which now are predominant, there would little or no cure be left, but then all things that are moſt miſchievous, would ſeem to be done by Law and Authority.</p>
            <p>The third obſervation is this, with what an evill conſcience theſe men undertooke this worke: They that pretended to take Armes to
<pb facs="tcp:155966:8"/>defend their own propriety, obtained a Commiſſion to violate the propriety of others, they would take the aſſertion of the Lawes of the Land, but aſſumed to them ſuch a power, as was moſt contrary to that Law, to ſeize upon their perſons without due proceſſe, to impoſe upon their eſtates without conſent, to take away ſome lives by the Law martiall; and beſides all this, without any Commiſſion they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to alter the government of the City, which is now governed by your own Councel, by a Magiſtrate choſen by your ſelves, then to be governed by violence.</p>
            <p>The fourth obſervation is this, that the miſchievous effect of this deſigne would not have ceaſed in the firſt nights worke, all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part in the kingdom, all faithfull Miniſters eſpecially, would have been left not onely to the ſcorn and reproach, but to the hatred, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and cruelty of the Papiſts, and Malignants.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt obſervation I ſhall make to you, is this, that this matter was proſecuted in part, and agitated and promoted by thoſe that were ſent from the King, and ſeemed to be meſſengers of peace; and while we ſhould be amazed with pretences of gracious Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, to propoſe peace, this villainous project, which ſhould have ſet you all in blood was promoted by thoſe Meſſengers, and ſhould have been put in execution very ſhortly after. This is all I ſhall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with by way of obſervation.</p>
            <p>The matters reſolved on in the Houſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, are theſe things: Firſt that there be publique thankeſgiving to God, both in the City, and throughout the Kingdom for this great deliverance, that a neere day be appointed for the City, the Parliament, &amp; the parts adjacent, &amp; a convenient day for other parts of the Kingdom. The next thing reſolved on, was, that the Houſe of Peeres, they ſhould be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe proofes, and with all this diſcovery, which hath been done accordingly. It was likewiſe reſolved, that there ſhould be a Covenant made, whereby we ſhould both teſtifie our deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this miſchievous plot, and joyne our ſelves more cloſely in the maintenance of the common intereſt of the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in Religion and liberty, which are ſtill in great danger, and would have beene utterly ſubverted, if this project had taken effect.
<pb facs="tcp:155966:8"/>It was reſolved in the fourth place, which is now partly executed, that this ſhould be communicated to you of the City, that ſo as you have a great part in the bleſſing, you may doe your part in the duty of thankfulneſſe, together with us. It is further reſolved, that it ſhall be communicated to the Army, that they likewiſe take notice of this great mercy of God, and joyne with us, both in the thankſgiving, and in the proteſtation and Covenant, as we ſhal like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſire you of the City to doe.</p>
            <p>Then we are commanded to give thankes to my Lord Major, to the Sheriffes, and to the reſt of the Officers of the City, for their great care in the apprehending of theſe perſons, in guarding the peace and the quiet of the City.</p>
            <p>We are likewiſe to give thankes to thoſe Gentlemen, that have had the cuſtody of theſe priſoners; we know it cannot but be a trouble to them, there was no meanes to keepe them ſafe from meſſages one to another, and from ſpeeches, but by ſuch a way of putting them in honeſt mens hands; The Houſe of Commons have commanded us, to give them ſpeciall thankes that they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this care, and to aſſure them that they will ſee them fully recompenced for all the trouble, and charge they ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe by it.</p>
            <p>And we are to give you thanks, which are the Citizens of this City, for your good affections to the publique cauſe, and for your continuall bounty for the ſupport of it.</p>
            <p>Thus farre we are enjoyn'd by the reſolution of the Houſe: Now wee are further to entreate you, to heare both the Covenants, you ſhall thereby know, to what wee have bound our ſelves, and to what we deſire you ſhould be bound; there are two Covenants, that is, one proper for the Houſes of Parliament, which hath been taken in the Houſe of Commons by all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by thoſe Gentlemen that are named in thoſe examinations to have been privy to this plot, which they all have diſavowed; and the other Covenant is to be taken by all the other part of the Kingdome, by the Citizens, by the Army, and the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally in all places.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155966:9"/>The draught of theſe two Covenants we ſhall communicate to you; the Houſe of Lords they have had them already, and have taken them into conſideration; and we hear, they doe reſolve that, which is appointed for them, ſhall be taken by the members of that Houſe.</p>
            <p>We are further to deſire you, that you would be ſerviceable to the Divine providence, to Gods great mercy to this City, and the whole Kingdome: God doth not onely do good, but thereby gives aſſurance that he will do good; His mercies they are comforts for the preſent, they are pledges for the future; but yet our care muſt not ceaſe.</p>
            <p>We are to deſire that you would keepe your guards, and looke well to your City, and that you would finde out theſe evill mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that are among you, as neere as may be, that ſo for the time to come this plot may be prevented, as hitherto hath been ſtopped, for out of doubt all the malignity is not drawn out of them, though the preſent opportunity is hindered for the preſent of putting it in execution.</p>
            <p>I am to tell you further, that in deſire to win thoſe that ſhall be taken with remorſe for this wicked defigne and conſpiracy: It is reſolved, that if any man ſhall come in before the 15. day of this preſent June, and freely confeſſe his fault, and what he knowes of this conſpiracy, that he ſhall have a full, and free, and plenary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the time to come, except thoſe that are already taken or fled; I ſay, thoſe that come in voluntarily ſhall be pardoned.</p>
            <p>Your care, and our care, they will be all little enough; wee hope Gods bleſſing will be ſo upon them both, that you ſhall be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a full peace, and that in the meane time you ſhall enjoy ſuch a degree of ſafety and proſperity, as may make way to it.</p>
